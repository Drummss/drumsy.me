        <Text>
          I have dabbled in a large range of languages and have spent a good bit
          of time running gaming communities in the past. Languages I have some
          experience with are Javascript/Typescript, C#, PHP, HTML, Lua, and
          Actionscript 3. When I was younger, I was determined to become a game
          developer. I still enjoy game development but, as of late, I have
          found developing websites and bots for Discord to be very fun. Where I
          consider myself a full-stack developer, most of my experience lately
          has been on the front end. However, my main side project right now -
          Pandabot - has allowed me an opportunity to work with a full stack
          once again. I also have some experience working with servers - mostly
          CentOS 7.

      <Spacer h={8} />
      <Text fontSize='smaller'>
        It's looking pretty empty down here... check back another time and
        perhaps I will have added more things to look at!
