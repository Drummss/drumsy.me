        Unknown Infernos was one of my original communities from years and years ago. The community is completely dormant and the website is pretty broken at this point as it relies on depreciated APIs. The website was made in PHP using my own nieve framework which handled ajax requests and database queries. It goes to say that I have learnt a lot from this project.

      <Paragraph>
        If I think there is any room for success or I decide I am bored enough then I will remake this project in React/NextJS. This would be to adopt a microservice approach which I think would fit this project much better than fundamentally monolithic foundations.

        The repository for this is currently closed source but if you are an employer feel free to contact me to request more information about the source code. There are plans to open source this but I first need to make sure no sensitive information would be leaked by doing so.
